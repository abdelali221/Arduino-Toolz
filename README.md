# Arduino-Toolz
 A Toolbox for the Arduino!

# Features :

 - Clock (Not implemented yet on V2)
 - Terminal
 - Analog/Digital PIN Tools (Beta)
 - Module Testers (IR/UltraSonic/DHT11/Keypad) (Beta)
 - EEPROM Tool (Beta)
 - Hot-Plug a LCD Display (Beta)

 # How to Use :

Just upload the Project to your Arduino after downloading the required Libraries, then you'll be done!

 -REQUIREMENTS :
 - An Arduino (This program was tested with an Arduino UNO)
 - A I2C LCD display (Needed)

After uploading the project you should get "Waiting for a command" on the LCD. The program is controllable via Serial with commands.

# The commands : 

 - Terminal
 - Clock (Not implemented yet on V2)
 - Analog
 - Digital
 - IR (Not implemented yet on V2)
 - Sensor (For DHT11) 
 - UltraR (For the UltraSonic Sensor) Not implemented yet on V2)
 - Keypad (Not implemented yet on V2)
 - LCD (LCD tools)
 - EEPROM
 - Rave (pattern for LCD TEST) (Not available in V1)
