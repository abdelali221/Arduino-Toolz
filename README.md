# Arduino-Toolz
 A Toolbox for the Arduino!

# Features :

 - Terminal (Using the LCD Display if you have one)
 - Analog/Digital PIN Tools (Will be removed since I'm working on a separate tool) 
 - Module Testers (IR/UltraSonic/DHT11/Keypad)
 - EEPROM Tool

 # How to Use :

Just upload the Project to your Arduino after downloading the required Libraries, then you'll be done!

 REQUIREMENTS :
 - An Arduino
 - A I2C LCD display (Optional)

The program uses commands that are sent using a Terminal (Not the Serial Monitor).
You should use a software like Putty or Tera Term.

# The commands : 

 - Terminal
 - Analog-Tool
 - Digital-Tool
 - Sensor (DHT11) 
 - UltraR (For the UltraSonic Sensor)
 - LCD (LCD tools)
 - EEPROM (EEPROM tools)
 - Rave (pattern for LCD TEST)

# Notes :

	DON'T USE THE Arduino-ToolzV1 NOR Arduino-ToolzV2_OLD SINCE THEY ARE BOTH OUTDATED, Use ArduinoToolzV2 instead.
